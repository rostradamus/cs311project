# Explanations on Corrections for Resubmit
# For the project-background-report

Most of the corrections we have made revolve around the notes you have
left for us in the report feedback. 

1. Section 2 (Introduction) and Section 3 (Value Proposition) Merge

We have received feedback that it was unnecessary to divide the sections
as such, so we have merged the two sections into one section under the
number and title of 2. VALUE PROPOSITION. This way the flow became more
natural and better to read. 

2. Elaboration on Alternatives (Originally Section 3.2, now Section 2.3)

On our original background report, research on alternatives was weak. 
Therefore, we have extended our research on the different alternatives
to our very own DSL Loopy, and compared each of them to see why they 
were not enough to fulfill our goals. 

3. Deletion of Lexical Scoping

Following the feedback, it seemed the lexical scoping aspect was unnecessary
to talk about without the talk of identifiers. Therefore, we deleted this
section.

4. Shortening of the Interpretation

The original report had an extensive description of our implementation of the
interpretor. This seemed unnecessary. Thus, we have removed most of it and
replaced it with a simple explanation on some of the key concepts that our
interpretor should have.
