For teams, rough breakdown of work:

We had a rough plan outline to allocate the different TODOs to each member of the team. 
If the team members did not finish their part within an internally chosen timeline (~2 days), 
we resorted to solving it together as a team.

Roughly, each member did an equivalent of 1.8 (one point eight) TODO amount of work.

====================== THEORY =======================

NONE THIS TIME! (Though there's an optional one in the write-up.)
