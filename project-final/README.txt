CPSC 311 Project 90% Deliverable Resubmit:


The following changes were made based on feedback received:

1. The beginning of section 3 was updated with explicit information on what was already implemented for the 90% deliverable and what will be completed for the 100% deliverable.

2. Error handling was added to Section 3, the low risk approach to our 100% deliverable.

3. Section 4 was expanded to include 4.2 Music Visualization and 4.3 Export Capabilities. These are significantly riskier than what we had before.
