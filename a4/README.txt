Please fill out each TODO item in the header.

Please don't reformat the HEADER area of this file, and change nothing except the TODOs, particularly nothing before the colon ":" on each line! 

We reserve the right to do (minor) point deductions for misformatted READMEs.

IF MULTIPLE TEAM MEMBERS SUBMIT, ensure that all but one resubmit with nothing but a file named IGNORE.txt.

Team name (for fun!): TODO

Acknowledgment that you understand and have followed the course's collaboration policy (READ IT at
http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs311/current/_syllabus.php#Collaboration_Policy):

Signed: TODO (put your names here again as a signature)

===================== LOGISTICS =====================

Please fill in each of the following:

Acknowledgment of assistance (per the collab policy!): TODO

For teams, rough breakdown of work: TODO (no more than a paragraph needed!)

====================== THEORY =======================

1. "There are 3 dice: 2 fair dice and a biased die. The distribution
   of the biased die is (1 2 3 3 4 5 6). The three dice are placed in
   a bag, and you draw a die from the bag and roll the die. What is
   the probability that you will roll a 3?"

   Write a program in ISE that computes the answer to the question
   above by inference. Include comments to briefly explain how your
   program works.

   TODO

2. In this assignment we keep the weight of the program as a state,
   which we pass around as a parameter and return value, instead of
   just passing it as a parameter like the environment. Give an
   example program in concrete syntax where the interpreter would fail
   to give the correct result (including likelihood!) if we had passed
   the state the same way as the environment. Briefly explain what the
   expected result is, what this improperly implemented interpreter
   would produce, and why.
